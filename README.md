# Framework Emulator
Game Engine  = Godot


Framework emulator is a small fake desktop game  ,where you can play my old siege games,can see 3 programmer jokes,6 different youtube videos and Countdown when siege is ending(not 100% accurate but usabele).im kinda disappointed of the result ,because i could not add  a lot of things which i wanted to add ,because of school issues.
